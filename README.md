1: How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating "user stories" help with this? 

I interpret user needs by looking at what their goal is, what features they want, what functionality they would like, and what changes they would want. A user story would help with this because it would add clarity to what the goal is by adding descriptions and explanations of what features are wanted, and how they would be expected to function from the user perspective. 

2: How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I approach developing a program by working toward achieving functionality in a way that I would like a program to. Agile processes I hope to incorporate into my future development work is working incrementally and in sprints with the goal of a shippable product in each sprint. 

3: What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
